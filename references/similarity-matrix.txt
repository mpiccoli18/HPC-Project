Computes the similarity matrix for a given matrix of size n x d.
Each entry (i, j) of the similarity matrix represents a similarity score for point i and point j of the input matrix;
similarity 1 means the points are identical, while similarity 0 means the points are far away.
The diagonal is set to 0, for the sake of graph Laplacians.
The sigma parameter controls the width of the Gaussian.
